# Incarcerated Joker
A multi-layered web-based user authentication system which incorporates behavioural biometrics.

## Description
We have built a 2-step user verification system which uses MFA to validate the user's identity. The MFA setup involves the use of 2 identity parameters:
- Username/Password
- Behavioural Biometrics

This project has been built using scripting languages such as PHP, HTML, JavaScript and CSS.
